This folder contains code implementations of the techniques used and developed in the thesis. Mainly the Simmulated Annealing procedure, BDCM entropy plots calculation (on a full general graphy) and the History Passing Reinforcement algorithm (in various versions (numpy and pytorch) and for RRG and general (or ER) graphs). The code is vectorized and utilizes the dynamic programming approach described in the thesis.
